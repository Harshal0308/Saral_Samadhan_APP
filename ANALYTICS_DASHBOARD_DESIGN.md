```

### For Coordinators:
```
💡 Action Items:
• Pune Center needs 2 more volunteers (volunteer-student ratio: 1:20)

## 🚀 Quick Win: Minimal Analytics (Start Here)

If you want to start small, implement this first:

### Dashboard Summary Cards (30 minutes)
```dart
// lib/pages/dashboard_page.dart
Row(
  children: [
    _buildStatCard('Attendance', '88%', Icons.check_circle, Colors.green),
    _buildStatCard('Students', '250', Icons.people, Colors.blue),
    _buildStatCard('Vol Hours', '120h', Icons.access_time, Colors.orange),
  ],
)
```

### Key Insights Section (1 hour)
```dart
// Calculate and show:
• Students with <50% attendance
• Most taught subject today
• Volunteer with most hours this week
```

### At-Risk Students List (1 hour)
```dart
// Filter students where:
• Attendance < 50% AND
• Test scores < 60% (if available)
// Show in red card with "Needs Attention" badge
```

---

## 📊 Sample Analytics Queries

### Get Attendance Percentage:
```dart
double getAttendancePercentage(String studentId, DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate) {
  // Count present days / total days
}
```

### Get Top Performers:
```dart
List<Student> getTopPerformers(int limit) {
  // Sort by attendance % + test scores
}
```

### Get Volunteer Hours:
```dart
double getVolunteerHours(String volunteerId, DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate) {
  // Sum (outTime - inTime) from volunteer reports
}
```

## 🎨 Color Coding System

- 🟢 Green: Good (>75%)
- 🟡 Yellow: Warning (50-75%)
- 🔴 Red: Critical (<50%)
- 🔵 Blue: Neutral/Info
- 🟣 Purple: Excellent (>90%)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your starting point**: Full dashboard or quick wins?
2. **I can implement**: 
   - Basic dashboard with summary cards
   - Attendance analytics page with charts
   - Student progress tracking
   - Volunteer impact analytics
   - Or all of the above!
